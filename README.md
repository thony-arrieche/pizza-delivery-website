<h1>Pizza Restaurant and Delivery website</h1>

I love Pizza! This is a mock website for a Pizza restaurant. 
This time I used modal menus, CSS animations and some JS to apply on scroll animations and resets.
The site is built on vanilla HTML, and Bootstrap v5.3 for the templates and responsive behaviour.
The idea is to have a fully functional page that stores everything of interest in one view, the main menu,
food menu and order menu sections.
Animations, keyframes with CSS are used for better understand and practice.
I may add an external page for the payment processor (not so convinced)

V.0.1
Navbar already built. Pending functionality to the Location button, My Order button. I plan to use modal menus!
Current version has a Hero banner (planning on using an auto slider), a side main menu, a central food menu button (style and position pending)

V.0.2
Add Maps API, and Text slider section for the Reviews (slider with controls)
